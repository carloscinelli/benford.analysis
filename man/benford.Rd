\title{Benford Analysis of a dataset}
\usage{
benford(data, number.of.digits = 2, sign = "positive",
  discrete = TRUE, round = 3, data.name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a numeric vector.}

\item{number.of.digits}{how many first digits to analyze.}

\item{sign}{The default value for sign is "positive" and it analyzes only data greater than zero. 
There are also the options "negative" and "both" that will analyze only negative values or both positive and negative values of the data,
respectively. For large datasets with both positive and negative numbers, 
it is usually recommended to perform a separate analysis for each group,
for the incentives to manipulate the numbers are usually different.}

\item{discrete}{most real data - like population numbers or accounting data - are discrete, so 
the default is TRUE. This parameter sets rounding to the differences of the ordered data to avoid floating point number
errors in the second order distribution, that usually occurs when data is discrete
and the ordered numbers are very close to each other. If your data is continuous
(like a simulated lognormal) you should run with discrete = FALSE.}

\item{round}{it defines the number of digits that the rounding will use if discrete = TRUE.}

\item{data.name}{the name of your data to show. If \code{NULL} (the default), the name of the passed object will be used.}
}

\description{
This function validates a dataset using Benford's Law.
Its main purposes are to find out where the dataset deviates from Benford's Law and 
to identify suspicious data that need further verification. 

For a more complete example, see the package help at \link{benford.analysis}.
